# UI polish + convenience features — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Status:** Approved — proceeding to plan/implementation on `feat/ui-convenience`

## Purpose

Make Inkshelf a bit prettier and more convenient for day-to-day e-reader use:
integrate the logo/favicon assets, let a user favorite a library (jump straight
into it), tighten the item listing for small e-ink screens, and add search so
you don't have to page through everything to find a title.

All additions keep the near-zero-JavaScript rule: plain `<form>` and `<a>` only.

## Assets

Source assets live in `temp/logo/` (gitignored). Copy into the repo:

- **Web root `wwwroot/`** (favicon set — absolute paths in the manifest require
  root placement): `favicon.ico`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`,
  `apple-touch-icon.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`,
  `android-chrome-512x512.png`, `site.webmanifest`.
- **`wwwroot/img/`** (renamed, no spaces): `logo-black.png`, `logo-inverted.png`
  (wordmark), `icon-black.png`, `icon-inverted.png` (square).

`site.webmanifest`: set `name` and `short_name` to `Inkshelf` (generator left
them blank); keep the icons, `theme_color`/`background_color` `#ffffff`,
`display: standalone`.

`<head>` (in `_Layout.cshtml`) gains: `<link rel="icon">` (16/32 + ico),
`<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`, `<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">`,
and `<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">`.

E-ink is grayscale on a white background, so the **black** logo/icon variants
are used in the app. The **inverted** variants are used only for GitHub dark
mode in the README.

## README

Center the wordmark at the top using `<picture>` so it renders correctly in
both GitHub themes:

```html
<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="src/Inkshelf/wwwroot/img/logo-inverted.png">
    <img src="src/Inkshelf/wwwroot/img/logo-black.png" alt="Inkshelf" width="360">
  </picture>
</p>
```

## Layout / header

`_Layout.cshtml` gains a compact header shown on the authenticated pages:

`[icon] Libraries · ★`

- `[icon]` = `icon-black.png` (~24px tall), links to the full library list
  (`/?all=1`).
- `Libraries` = same target (text link).
- `★` = favorite toggle for the current library (only on the library page).

The **login page** shows the centered wordmark (`logo-black.png`) above the
form. Keep it small (constrained width) for e-ink.

## Favorite library

- Plain (unencrypted) cookie `inkshelf_fav_library=<libraryId>` — a UI
  preference, not a secret. HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, long max-age.
- **Toggle:** a small `<form method="post">` on the library page posting to a
  `POST /favorite` endpoint with the library id and an antiforgery token (same
  pattern as `/logout`). It sets the cookie to that id, or clears it if the id
  is already the favorite. Redirects back to `/library/{id}`.
- **Auto-redirect:** `GET /` (Index) redirects to `/library/{favId}` when the
  favorite cookie is set **and** the request has no `?all=1`.
- **Escape hatch:** the header `Libraries` link points at `/?all=1`, which
  always renders the full list regardless of the favorite.
- The ★ shows filled when the current library is the favorite, hollow
  otherwise (plain text `★` / `☆`).

## Item listing changes

- Page size **10** (was 24) — `LibraryModel.PageSize = 10`.
- Move the Prev/Next pager to the **top** of the list (above the rows). No
  bottom pager (save e-ink space).
- **Clickable author/series.** The items list is **always minified** in ABS
  (`getByFilterAndSort` calls `toOldJSONMinified` unconditionally; the
  `minified` query param does not change it), so rows carry author/series
  **names**, not ids. Each author links to `/library/{id}?author=<name>` and
  each series to `/library/{id}?series=<name>` (split the joined name strings;
  strip a trailing ` #<seq>` for the series link). The library page resolves
  the name → id via **one search call at click time**, then shows the filtered
  paged listing. Search-result Series/Authors groups already carry ids and link
  directly to `?filter=<group>.<base64(id)>`.
- Cover unchanged, except a missing cover now returns **404** (not 500), so a
  coverless item just shows no image. (No download affordance — that feature
  was scrapped and is out of scope for this iteration.)

## Search + filtered listing

The library page (`/library/{id}`) supports three modes, chosen by query params:

1. **Default** (no `q`, no `filter`): paged listing (10/page).
2. **Search** (`?q=<text>`): grouped results from
   `GET /api/libraries/{id}/search?q=&limit=`:
   - **Books** — matched items rendered like list rows (cover/title/author/
     series). The book match's item is the expanded form, so its author/series
     are clickable filter links too, exactly like the normal listing.
   - **Series** — each links to `/library/{id}?filter=series.<base64(seriesId)>`.
   - **Authors** — each links to `/library/{id}?filter=authors.<base64(authorId)>`.
   Search results are not paged (ABS caps them; use `limit=25`).
3. **Filtered** (`?filter=<group>.<b64>`): paged listing passing `filter`
   through to `GET /api/libraries/{id}/items?...&filter=...`.

A search `<form method="get" action="/library/{id}">` with a single `q` text
input sits at the top of the page in all modes. Filter mode shows a small
"Filtered by … · clear" line linking back to the unfiltered listing.

### Filter encoding

ABS decodes `filterBy` as `<group>.<value>` where `value` is
`base64(decodeURIComponent(...))`. Build it in C# as
`group + "." + Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(id))`, then
URL-encode when placing in the link (`+`/`/`/`=` are not URL-safe).

## Client / data additions (`AbsClient`, `AbsModels`)

- The items list is always minified, so `AbsMetadata` stays
  `{ Title, AuthorName, SeriesName }` (no id arrays — they aren't available).
  Author/series ids are resolved from names via `SearchAsync` at click time
  (see the listing section). `AbsRef`/`AbsSeriesRef` exist only for the search
  DTOs.
- `GetItemsAsync(..., string? filter = null)` — appends `&filter=<value>` when
  set (value already `group.<b64>`, URL-encoded).
- `SearchAsync(accessToken, libraryId, q, limit)` →
  `Task<AbsSearchResults>`; `GET /api/libraries/{id}/search?q=&limit=`.
- New DTOs:
  - `AbsSearchResults { List<AbsBookMatch> Book; List<AbsSeriesMatch> Series; List<AbsAuthorMatch> Authors; }`
  - `AbsBookMatch { AbsItem LibraryItem; }` (item is expanded → has
    `media.metadata` with author/series arrays)
  - `AbsSeriesMatch { AbsSeries Series; }` where `AbsSeries { Id, Name }`
  - `AbsAuthorMatch { Id, Name }`
  - Exact JSON keys confirmed against the ABS source during implementation.
- A small `AbsFilter.Encode(string group, string id)` helper (testable).

## Error handling

- Empty/whitespace `q` → treat as no search (render the default listing).
- Search or filter against a library the user can't access → the existing
  `AbsSession` auth flow / 404 handling applies; a bad `filter` value yields an
  empty listing.

## Integration test environment (transient seeded ABS)

To exercise the real page flows during implementation (not just unit tests), a
disposable ABS instance is seeded with data and run locally via Docker. This
mirrors abs-cli's `docker/` setup, **isolated so both projects' stacks can run
at once**:

- `docker/docker-compose.yml` — `advplyr/audiobookshelf:2.35.1`. Isolation from
  abs-cli: compose project `name: inkshelf-it`, host port **13379** (abs-cli
  uses 13378), own named volumes (prefixed by the project name),
  `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_MAX=0` so repeated logins during testing don't rate-limit.
- `docker/seed.sh` — initializes root (`root`/`root`), creates a book library,
  and uploads ~15 items (each created from a minimal generated EPUB, which is
  just the media file ABS needs to make a book item) across several authors and
  multiple series. Enough for **2+ pages** at 10/page, with distinct
  titles/authors/series for search and filter links. Then triggers a scan and
  waits for the items to index.
- `docker/smoke-test.sh` — drives Inkshelf's own HTTP routes end to end
  (login → cookie, libraries, items page, `?q=` search, `?filter=` listing,
  `/cover/{id}`), asserting status codes and key content. It discovers a
  library id via the ABS API (root token). Runs against a running Inkshelf
  pointed at any ABS.

**Reaching the seeded ABS from the devcontainer:** `host.docker.internal` is
unreliable inside the dev container, so resolve the ABS container IP and use
`http://<ip>:80` (documented in the plan). The stack runs on the host Docker
daemon (docker-outside-of-docker).

**Workflow:** during implementation, run Inkshelf against the **seeded** ABS
and verify the pages there. Once everything is verified there, run the smoke
test, and finally a manual smoke against the user's **real** ABS instance.

The seed/compose are committed (they're dev/test tooling); the ABS image and
volumes are transient and never committed.

## Testing

- `AbsClient.SearchAsync` parses book/series/authors from a fixture (StubHandler).
- `GetItemsAsync` includes `filter=` when supplied; omits it otherwise.
- `AbsFilter.Encode` produces `group.<base64>` for a known id.
- `GetItemsAsync` parses `metadata.authors[]`/`series[]` ids from a full
  (non-minified) item fixture, and no longer sends `minified=1`.
- Favorite toggle: setting/clearing the cookie and the `/` auto-redirect vs
  `?all=1` bypass (WebApplicationFactory, no live ABS).
- `Pager` math unchanged (existing tests stay).
- Existing 23 tests remain green.
- Integration: pages verified against the seeded ABS during implementation;
  `docker/smoke-test.sh` green against Inkshelf+seeded ABS; final manual smoke
  against the real ABS.

## Out of scope

- Item detail / reading pages (rows only).
- Ebook download (scrapped after the earlier test; a proper implementation is a
  separate future effort).
- Sorting controls, multi-facet filtering, saved searches.
- Global (cross-library) search.
- Image resizing of the provided PNGs (used as-is; revisit if e-ink load is slow).
- Wiring the seeded ABS into a CI smoke job (harness lands here; CI integration
  stays a follow-up).
